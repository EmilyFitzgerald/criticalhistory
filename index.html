        <p><strong>Source type:</strong> Documentary</p>
        
        
        
        <p>In original form, the documentary is six hours long, including archival footage from the 50s to the 80s. Only a few institutions have the full film; first three parts (two hours long) released on DVD 2008 (ACMI has it in their collection; lots of clips of it on YouTube.</p> 
        
        
        
        <p>Dehn was Russian, trained as a ballet dancer. She saw Josephine Baker in Paris in the 1920s, performing Charleston. Moved to New York 1930, went to the Savoy Ballroom soon after, fell in love with jazz, immersed herself in the scene, wanted to preserve for future generations.</p>
        
        
        
         <p>The documentary is split into three parts, each prefaced by Dehn, but then letting the footage speak for itself.</p>
        
        <p>Part 1, turn of the century to 1950;  Part 2 filmed at the savoy; Part 3 1950-80s, in a public school.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Dehn wanted to include dancing from the turn of the century, but of course there was no footage, so got Savoy Ballroom dancers to recreate the older styles in a studio; she then used the same format for the modern styles. A seperate soundtrack was recorded, due to technology available to her. </p>
